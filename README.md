# Big 4 Financial Risk Analysis

## ðŸ“˜ Overview:
This project, Big 4 Audit Data Analysis, explores financial risk, fraud detection, and compliance activity across leading accounting firmsâ€”PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, and Ernst & Young. Built entirely with Python, it offers a clear look into audit trends over multiple years, grounded in real-world data.

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset:
The dataset includes-

ðŸ”¹Audit records from 2020â€“2025

ðŸ”¹Firm names, industries, revenue impact
  Metrics like Compliance_Violations, Fraud_Cases_Detected, and High_Risk_Cases
  Workload, satisfaction, and effectiveness scores.

ðŸ”¹It provides a rich base for comparing how different firms and industries handle audit pressure.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:
âž¤ PwC and Deloitte led in audit volume, but Ernst & Young recorded unusually high counts of High_Risk_Cases in some years.

âž¤ Retail and Healthcare emerged as high-risk industries across multiple metrics.

âž¤ Significant variation in Employee_Workload and Audit_Effectiveness_Score suggests inconsistent operational efficiency between firms.

âž¤ KPMG showed a relatively stable pattern in terms of Fraud_Cases_Detected, with moderate Compliance_Violations.

## âœ… Recommendations:
âœ¦ Redistribute workloads in firms with high risk exposure and lower satisfaction scores.

âœ¦ Prioritize audits in Retail and Healthcare, where anomalies and violations occur frequently.

âœ¦ Standardize auditing practices across firms to level out disparities in effectiveness and workload.

âœ¦ Monitor year-on-year trends to identify early signs of performance dips or oversight gaps.
